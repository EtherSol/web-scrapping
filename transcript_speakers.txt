you just did a zombie movie uh not long

Speaker 2:
ago you did a zombie movie
and uh i was wondering we had the cast

Speaker 1:
of the walking dead here a couple days
ago
and i was asking them what they would do

Speaker 2:
in a zombie apocalypse and it seems to

Speaker 1:
be something that a lot of us these days
think about because zombies have become

Speaker 2:
so popular
did you think about that when you're
shooting that movie what you would do in
a zombie apocalypse
um no i didn't but

Speaker 1:
okay next question uh

Speaker 2:
just kidding i thought i've thought

Speaker 1:
about it
a lot and um i was telling someone the

Speaker 2:
other day that
um i i'm always prepared in any kind of

Speaker 1:
apocalypse situation not just

Speaker 2:
zombies but i have like a whole thing

Speaker 1:
like i sleep with a
dagger at by my side and don't

Speaker 2:
you really what do you mean you have a

Speaker 1:
dagger where where's the dagger it's not

Speaker 2:
in the bed it's my nightstand and

Speaker 1:
every week i do a shanking uh drill

Speaker 2:
where i i'm asleep you're asleep

Speaker 1:
i imagine like a zombie or a murderer

Speaker 2:
um or whoever is coming to get me right

Speaker 1:
and
and then i like have a move where i like

Speaker 2:
quickly slide it under the blanket and

Speaker 1:
then i just shank
up whoever's hovering over me about to

Speaker 2:
kill me

Speaker 1:
that seems incredibly dangerous you know

Speaker 2:
what if
uh someone's staying over at the house

Speaker 1:
what if your boyfriend's leaning over

Speaker 2:
for a kiss
and you've got that motion you enter

Speaker 1:
my room at your own risk okay all there

Speaker 2:
is
you always have you have weapons nearby

Speaker 1:
at all times i have
a dagger i also like to surround myself

Speaker 2:
with
people with skills that could be useful

Speaker 1:
um that's something i always keep in

Speaker 2:
mind with like friends or

Speaker 1:
boyfriends or whatever um you want them

Speaker 2:
to have useful skills if there's an
apocalypse of some kind

Speaker 1:
like what for example like my current

Speaker 2:
boyfriend
uh when we first started dating i gave

Speaker 1:
him helicopter lessons

Speaker 2:
flying lessons for his birthday he never

Speaker 1:
showed an interest in flying but i just

Speaker 2:
gave him
to him in case like the world has gone

Speaker 1:
to
and we need to fly away so

Speaker 2:
i was like i need to be with someone

Speaker 1:
that can operate

Speaker 2:
a helicopter first of all why don't you

Speaker 1:
take the helicopter last night because

Speaker 2:
i'm in charge of weapons and ammo

Speaker 1:
and then i would steal the helicopter

Speaker 2:
and then he would he would take it

Speaker 1:
so first of all you don't have a health
so you've got to get to a helicopter oh

Speaker 2:

in it
and steal he good enough then you can't

Speaker 1:

he's good at flying a helicopter after a

Speaker 1:
day he did it because he was scared

Speaker 2:
but um but i'll just get someone to do

Speaker 1:
it
i just have to have someone that knows

Speaker 2:
how to fly
